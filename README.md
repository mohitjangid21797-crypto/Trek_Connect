# Trek_Connect
This app helps people find and book trekking and camping trips based on their city. It features a safe "Room" system where groups can chat and share locations offline using Bluetooth. Trekking companies can register, manage trips, and use safety tools like geofencing and emergency beeps to keep all trekkers safe during their journey.
